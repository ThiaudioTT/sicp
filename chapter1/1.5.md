Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

```scheme
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer.

## My answer

**Applicative order:**

Evaluates test, 0 and (p) in this order.
Test will be a procedure, 0 will be 0 and (p) will be (p) (starting an infinite loop).


**Normal order:** fully expand (will evaluate only when needed)


(test 0 (p))
will be expended to the body of the operation:

```scheme
(if (= 0 0)
      0
      y)
```

Since 0 = 0 is true, the procedure returns 0 and (p) won't be evaluated.
