What are the values of the following expressions?

```lisp
(A 1 10)
(A 2 4)
(A 3 3)
```

You can solve it easy using math.

You will note that in the cases of (A 1 2) = 2^2, (A 1 10) = 2^10.

You can define it by simple drawing the function calling and returning phases and deduce it using math.

Using it and saving results like (A 2 4) you can find the results easier.

Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

```lisp
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
```
Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n. For example, (k n) computes 5n^2.

The previous hint comes a answer. So (A 1 n) is a function like f(x) = 2^x

# Ai answer:


The function `A` in Lisp is an implementation of the Ackermann function, which is a classic example of a computable function that is not primitive recursive. It is not a straightforward task to find a math function that is equivalent to the Ackermann function, as it is a highly recursive and complex function.

However, we can express the Ackermann function using mathematical notation as follows:

A(x, y) = 
{
  0                     if y = 0
  2y                    if x = 0
  2                     if x = 1 and y > 0
  A(x - 1, A(x, y - 1))  otherwise
}

This notation uses curly braces to define a piecewise function that returns different values depending on the values of x and y. The notation `A(x, y - 1)` is used to represent a recursive call to the Ackermann function with parameters (x, y - 1).

Note that this mathematical notation is just a symbolic representation of the original Lisp code, and it does not provide a closed-form formula for the Ackermann function. The Ackermann function grows extremely quickly, and its values quickly become too large to be computed by any practical means.


Unfortunately, it is not possible to express the Ackermann function as a simple mathematical function of the form f(x) = ax. The Ackermann function is a highly recursive function that requires multiple nested calls to itself, and its growth rate is much faster than any polynomial or exponential function. As a result, it cannot be expressed in terms of any elementary functions like polynomials, exponentials, or trigonometric functions.

However, there are some approximations and bounds that can be used to estimate the value of the Ackermann function for small values of x and y. For example, for small values of x and y, the Ackermann function can be approximated by a polynomial function or an exponential function. But for larger values of x and y, the function becomes more complex and cannot be approximated by any simple function.
