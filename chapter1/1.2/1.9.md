Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

```lisp
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```
Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

R:

The first is recursive
The second is iterative

I prove this drawing arrows and functions, see also the answer provided by
sip solutions, wich corresponds more to the question.

(+ 4 5) -> (+3 5) plus 1 -> (+ 2 5) plus 1 -> [...] -> (+ 0 5) plus 1 -> 5

Then we return:

5 -> (+ 0 5) plus 1 = 6 -> [...] -> 9

The diff here is that we find our solution when the function exit completely.
On iterative solution, we do it step by step until we reach the solution:

(+ 4 5) -> (+3 6) -> [...] -> (+ 0 9) -> 9


We can see more cleary on sicp solutions:

(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9 <--- Result when function exits


(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9 <--- We found it! We will return, but we already know the solution.

Both methods use recursion, but one process is recursive and the other is iterative.
